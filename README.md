> This is the code for my personal website. It uses a framework for the code, but the design is all mine.

Use the following commands to build & serve my website.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how the code works, I used [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), so all relevant information can be found there.
